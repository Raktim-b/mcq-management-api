# 📌 Project Overview

The **Q&A Management System API** is a RESTful backend application designed for online assessments, quizzes, and learning platforms.

Users can securely register, verify their email, browse questions by category, submit answers, and track their responses. The system also provides analytical reports using MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines without using `populate()` or raw JavaScript queries.

This project demonstrates real-world backend development concepts such as authentication, file uploads, aggregation, and many-to-many relationships.

# 🎯 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to build a secure Question & Answer Management System where users can:

- Register with email verification
- Login securely
- Manage their profile
- Upload profile pictures
- Browse questions by category
- Submit answers
- Search answered questions
- Generate category-wise reports

---

# 🚀 Business Scenario

Imagine an online learning platform where students need to complete multiple-choice assessments.

The platform should allow students to:

- Create an account
- Verify their email
- Access categorized MCQ questions
- Submit answers
- View submitted responses
- Search previous answers

Administrators should be able to analyze:

- Number of questions in each category
- User submissions
- Category statistics

MongoDB Aggregation is used to generate these reports efficiently.
